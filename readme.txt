== Description ==
Getting a quick update of your recent Freshbooks invoicing has never been easier. 
This free plugin allows users to send a report to a specified email address that 
shows them the daily and weekly amounts invoiced via Freshbooks for the current 
week and for the previous week, giving them a snapshot of their recent invoicing 
activity.


== INSTALLATION ==

Since you're reading the plugin's README.TXT, you've probably already done
this.  But if not, it's a standard WordPress plugin install.  Ie:-

1.  Log into the WordPress Admin section of the WordPress/WooCommerce site you
    want to install the plugin to.

2.  Go to "Plugins" --> "Add New" --> "Upload", then select and "Install Now"
    the plugin's ZIP file.

3.  Once it's been installed, "Activate" the plugin as prompted (or manually
    activate it later from the "Plugins" screen, if you prefer).
